# Dog Breed App Challenge

This exercise is a bare-bones version of a dog breed app, where we ask candidates to build out a small application. The goal: give both the candidate and the FAST AI Movies team a chance to interact on a realistic, but limited (shooting for just a few hours), task. We see this as a two-way evaluation for the team and the candidate to decide if it's a good fit.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- React (with TypeScript)
- Vite
- React Context API (for state management)
- Vitest (for testing)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/Philipp-FastAIMovies/DogBreedApp_Challenge.git

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

npm install

### 3️⃣ Start the Development Server

npm run dev

The app will be running at `http://localhost:5173/`.

## 🌐 The Dog API

This is the API that should be used: https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/breed
Especially important are
- List all breeds
- By breed

## 🎯 Your Task

### Live Coding Challenge (20-30 minutes)

✅ Select dog breeds  
✅ View breed images  
✅ Search/Filter Dropdowen for selecting the Breed (if time left)  

### Take-home Assignment (2-3 hours)

✅ Search/Filter Dropdowen for selecting the Breed  
✅ Add/remove favorites by heart click  
✅ Add/remove favorites by Drad'n'Drop  
✅ Use **React Context** for state management  
✅ Test with **Vitest**  

## 💻 Sample Visualization

This is what a very simple version of the app could look like:

## 📂 Project Structure

Your goal is to build an extensible and maintainable project structure following best practices.

## 🧪 Running Tests

To run tests using **Vitest**, use the following command:

npm run test

## 📌 Notes

- Ensure you have **Node.js** installed (recommended: version 18+).
- If using **pnpm** or **yarn**, replace `npm` with `pnpm` or `yarn` in commands.
